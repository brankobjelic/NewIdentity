# NewIdentity
Scaffolded ASP.NET Core Razor Pages app with customized ASP.NET Identity functionality and UI to meet a client's needs.  
Entity Framework ORM is used with MySQL database.

Features:  
Created Admin and User roles.  
Only an Account with the Admin role can register a new account with the User role.  
Only an Account with the Admin role can delete an account.  
Implemented logical deletion instead of physical deletion of users, so it can be undone.
